Gandi DynDNS

To configure the script for your domain to update the Gandi entry just fill it
in with your Gandi key and secret.

```json
{
    "key": "qH3Df29ysxdDaT8p7PWMRV8rVuU75EjHy",
    "domain": "main-domain.eu",
    "subdomain": "subdomain"
}
```

and save it as conf.json
Call the script regularly. It will try to avoid contacting external services as
much as possible.
Subdomain can also be a list of subdomains to set.
